How to find S3 Buckets:

You can use many online tools which are available on GitHub to find S3 bucket of a website. I would like to list down few of them:
Lazy S3
bucket_finder
AWS Cred Scanner
sandcastle
Mass3
Dumpster Diver
S3 Bucket Finder
S3Scanner

AWS S3 comes equipped with a range of permissions and access control mechanisms which if in the case overlooked by administrators and improperly implemented can act as a treasure of data

Misconfigured AWS S3 buckets that leave unauthorized access are thus abused by attackers to compromise the privacy of the data stored in those buckets breaching the privacy of millions of users around the world. If the case misconfigured S3 Bucket contains EC2 snapshot instances, then attackers might be able to retrieve the snapshot instance and then get security keys for the EC2 instance itself.
