How to find S3 Buckets:

You can use many online tools which are available on GitHub to find S3 bucket of a website. I would like to list down few of them:
Lazy S3
bucket_finder
AWS Cred Scanner
sandcastle
Mass3
Dumpster Diver
S3 Bucket Finder
S3Scanner

AWS S3 comes equipped with a range of permissions and access control mechanisms which if in the case overlooked by administrators and improperly implemented can act as a treasure of data
